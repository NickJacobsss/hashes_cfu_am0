# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
   * I felt very confident until the last example of the last practice, where i was required to do an if statement inside of sorting a hash, which proved to be very difficult for me.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
   * note taking is going great, I have a turing/mod0 folder in my apple notes, and then a sub section for each practice
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
  * I like to try to solve it on my own if it is a matter of correctly writing the code, but if i dont know the correct syntax for that operation, i will go to classmates/google
